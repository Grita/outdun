## Exit dungeons without relogging

#### Usage
- Click the triangle button in the upper left corner of the minimap to exit the instanced zone you are in.

#### Broken stuff
- This won't restore your HP/SP to how they were before you entered the instance.
- This will sometimes teleport you to the map entrance for some reason.
